"""Authored default bodies for the events/bookings/maintenance/membership streams.

Separated from the registry module for the same reason the hardware/printing defaults
are: strings are bulk, structure is not, and mixing them puts both past the file ceiling.

Two rules these defaults follow, and a reader changing them should keep:

* **A staff default reproduces what the adapter sends today.** The four adapters built
  their bodies inline in Python; moving that wording here verbatim is what makes the
  switch to the template path a no-op for a space that never edits one.
* **A requester default never contains staff-only detail.** Requester wording addresses
  the person the notification is about, and it is the body a member reads — so no other
  member's name, no internal ids beyond their own, no staff notes.
