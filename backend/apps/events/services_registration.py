    the public. Every other rule (published, not ended, capacity, duplicates, the
    custom form, the write fence, and payment) is identical, because this is the same
    service and the state machine has one home.

    `collaborative=True` is a trusted internal capability restricted to the enforcing
    member view. That view proves an accepted EventCollaborator exists; this service
    deliberately does not re-derive the actor's makerspace membership.
