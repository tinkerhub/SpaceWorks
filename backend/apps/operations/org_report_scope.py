"""Organization-owned makerspace scope for the reports dashboard.

COMBINED mode flattens rows across makerspaces, which the report-grouping invariant
otherwise forbids ("aggregate output groups by makerspace_id and never flattens
cross-tenant data"). A Stage-4 review flagged that correctly, and the invariant was
amended on 2026-08-20 with a bounded exception -- see docs/INVARIANTS.md under
"Reports/analytics extend one registry". This module is condition (1) of that exception:
the id set is resolved HERE, server-side, and never accepted from a client. Condition (2)
is the OWNER-only link filter below. Conditions (3) and (4) -- that a combined total only
ever ACCOMPANIES the per-makerspace breakdown, and that COMBINED is the only flattening
mode -- must be enforced by the aggregation layer that consumes this scope.
