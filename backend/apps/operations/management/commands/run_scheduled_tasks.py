"""Run the periodic tasks a deployment without Celery beat would otherwise never run.

**This is the one thing that stops working silently in cloud mode.** With no broker,
`CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER` makes `.delay()` run inline, so everything a request triggers
still works and nothing looks broken -- but `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` is beat's business,
and with no beat process nothing ever fires it. `send_return_reminders` is a duty-of-care
message in the accountability flow: a member who has not returned hardware simply stops
being reminded, and the first sign is a dispute months later.

So this exists to be driven by whatever scheduler the host already has -- a platform cron
entry, a Kubernetes CronJob, systemd timer:

    */15 * * * *  python manage.py run_scheduled_tasks --due-only

Each task declares its own cadence here, mirroring `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE`, and
`--due-only` makes the command idempotent under a coarser cron: a 15-minute cron running
an hourly task fires it once an hour, not four times. State lives in `PeriodicTaskRun`
rows rather than a file, because a cloud host's filesystem is not durable and two web
dynos would not share one.

Deliberately NOT an authenticated HTTP endpoint. A URL that runs jobs is a URL someone
can find, and rate-limiting it correctly is more work than a cron entry.
