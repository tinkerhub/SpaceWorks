"""Superadmin-only per-module data purge (plan A9).

This is NOT `lifecycle.purge()`. That deletes an entire archived makerspace; this
deletes one module's rows while the makerspace stays live and every other module
keeps working.

The contract that makes it safe to offer at all:

* **Uninstall first.** A module must already be uninstalled (tombstoned) before its
  data can be purged. Uninstall is reversible and retains everything; purge is the
  separate, explicit, irreversible second step. Requiring the order means no single
  command can both hide and destroy.
* **Superadmin only**, mirroring `lifecycle.purge()`.
* **One transaction**, with immutability triggers bypassed for DELETE only, exactly
  as the makerspace purge does -- `session_replication_role='replica'` on self-host,
  the `app.allow_immutable_delete` GUC on managed Postgres where the replication role
  is forbidden. Both are `SET LOCAL`, so a crash can never leave the append-only
  guards durably disabled.
* **Object storage last.** Keys are collected before the delete and removed after the
  commit, best-effort: a failed S3 call must not roll back a completed purge.
