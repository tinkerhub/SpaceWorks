"""Install profiles for a new instance.

Opt-in modules only work if choosing them is easy. A bare Frappe-style empty
install would contradict this project's non-technical-install story, so
`setup.sh`/`setup.ps1` and `setup_instance` offer named profiles instead of
leaving the operator to discover the module system on their own.

# NOTE ON HOW LEAN A PROFILE CAN GET. Six modules are core and no profile can drop them
# -- `public_inventory`, `request_workflow`, `staff_admin`, `evidence_uploads`,
# `qr_management`, `scanner` -- because the Hard Rules require a box QR scan AND an issue
# photo to hand hardware over, so the loan spine is the system rather than a feature of
# it. `workshop` therefore still ships the request workflow; what it does not ship is
# everything else. A deployment that wants to go further removes whole apps with
# TOMBSTONED_APPS, which is a different axis -- `suggest_tombstones` reads the installed
# modules and names the apps that are safe to drop.
