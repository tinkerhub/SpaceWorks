"""Canonical registry of makerspace modules.

Single source of truth for module keys, their defaults, frontend exposure and
inter-module dependencies. The parallel hand-kept lists that used to drift apart
-- ``models.DEFAULT_ENABLED_MODULES``, ``platform.MODULE_WORKFLOWS``,
``capabilities.FEATURE_MODULES`` and the hardcoded ``printing -> machine_service``
rule -- all derive from here now.

This module must NOT import ``apps.makerspaces.models``. ``models`` imports the
derived helpers from here, so the reverse edge would be a circular import.
