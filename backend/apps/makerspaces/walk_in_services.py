"""Staff-created person records for people who will never hold an account.

This is the identity path an accounts-off deployment runs on, and it is deliberately
**not** gated by any module. A person record is core RBAC state, the same reasoning
that keeps the staff roster ungated (plan A7), while `accounts` now means self-service
enrolment rather than identity itself. This path stays available with `accounts` on
too: a space that runs member accounts still has walk-ins at the counter.

The record is a real `User` with an **unusable password** and no verified email, which
is what makes creating one an act of *naming a person*, not of provisioning a login.
Everything downstream then works untouched, because every requester relation in the
system is a non-null PROTECT FK to `User` on a PII-mapped model: direct handouts,
machine-service jobs submitted on a member's behalf, accountability and the
access-restriction flow all take this row exactly as they take a self-registered one.

    Public because it has a second caller: `apps.checkin.identity` mints one per
    upstream check-in identity, deliberately WITHOUT the membership that
    `create_walk_in_member` adds. A makerspace running the check-in gate has the
    `membership` module off, so there is no membership to create and inventing a
    tenant-binding row would contradict the operator's configuration.

    A typed email that already belongs to someone is refused rather than attached, and
    that refusal is the security boundary of this endpoint. Binding an account to a
    roster is a membership decision -- it belongs to the members list under
    `MANAGE_MAKERSPACE`, not to a front-desk form held by anyone with
    `ISSUE_DIRECT_LOAN`. Attaching instead would also silently reactivate a membership
    someone deliberately revoked, through the one form whose entire purpose is naming a
    stranger.
