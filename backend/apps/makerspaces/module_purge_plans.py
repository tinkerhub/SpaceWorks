"""What "purge this module's data" means, per module (plan A9).

Per-app purge is NEW semantics and deliberately narrower than `lifecycle.purge()`,
which deletes an entire archived makerspace. Here the makerspace survives; only one
module's rows, its private object-storage keys and its blind-index entries go.

Each plan declares three things the service needs and cannot infer:

* `delete` -- rows in dependency order, run inside the authorized purge context
  (immutability triggers bypassed for DELETE only).
* `pii_labels` -- registry model labels whose `PiiBlindIndex` rows must go too.
  Blind-index rows carry keyed HMACs of PII and have **no FK** to the source row, so
  nothing deletes them for us; leaving them behind is a genuine PII leak.
* storage collectors -- private keys and public image keys, deleted post-commit.

A module absent from this registry has no purgeable data of its own, or its graph is
inseparable from the makerspace's (see `NOT_SEPARABLE`).
