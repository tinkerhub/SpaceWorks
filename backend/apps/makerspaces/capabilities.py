    `payments.enabled` would still be set and would demand the very module being taken
    away, so the operation is impossible rather than merely lossy.

    Keeping the feature instead is not an option: the capability would read as ON while
    every surface behind it was gone. The staff console already works this way (a
    checkbox disabled by its parent module is omitted from the PATCH and clears the
    capability), so this makes the service agree with the UI rather than fight it.
