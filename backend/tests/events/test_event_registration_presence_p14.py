"""Phase 0: event registration requires membership + waiver, but NOT presence.

Registering for an event is planning to attend, not attending. A member signing up in
advance from home cannot hold an open `PresenceSession`, so requiring one made advance
registration impossible and made a collaborating space's member unable to register at all.
Physical attendance is established instead by the staff-scanned QR check-in, which is
stronger evidence than a self-declared session.

What must NOT change is every other flow that asks the same question. Those are hardware
and facility actions where "is this member physically here right now" is the point, so
`require_active_member_presence` keeps its session requirement and keeps its callers.
