"""Deploy-manifest drift guard (plan Track D, phase 15).

`a9cd82c` fixed one instance of a class of bug: a setting the code reads that no deploy
manifest passes. `PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL` defaulted to a localhost URL, so password-reset
links worked when you tested from the server console and were unclickable for every real
user. Nothing failed, nothing logged. This file is the test that would have caught it.

The naive contract -- "every env var the code reads appears in every manifest" -- is the
wrong one, and worth saying why so it does not get re-litigated. The backend reads ~134
variables and all but two have defaults; most are tuning knobs (`THROTTLE_*`, TTLs, size
caps) whose defaults are correct in production and which would be noise in a manifest.
Requiring them all would make `.env.example` an unreadable reference and train everyone
to add exemptions.

The discriminator is not "does it have a default" but **"does its default work off-box"**.
A default of 300 seconds is right everywhere. A default of `http://localhost:9000` is
right only where the browser and the server are the same machine, which is exactly the
deployment nobody actually runs and exactly the one a developer tests from. So:

* on-box defaults in `settings.py` must be overridden by the production manifests;
* the same for on-box fallbacks written at the **consumer**, which is where
  `PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL` hid -- its `settings.py` default is a harmless `""` and the
  localhost string lives in `platform.py`, so a settings-only scan misses it entirely;
* no manifest may set a variable the backend never reads, which is how a rename leaves a
  manifest quietly passing a dead name;
* and the proxy/TLS posture must be explicit rather than defaulted, because both of its
  wrong answers are silent.
