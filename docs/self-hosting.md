# Self-Hosting Guide

This project is Docker-first for operators who do not want to build Django or Vite locally.

## Pinned curl install

The supported fresh-install path needs no Git clone:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpaceWorks-HQ/SpaceWorks/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer defaults to `/opt/spaceworks`; override it on the `bash` process with, for example,
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpaceWorks-HQ/SpaceWorks/main/install.sh | SPACEWORKS_DIR="$HOME/SpaceWorks" bash`.
It resolves the latest tagged GitHub release,
downloads that tag's archive, and pins the published backend/frontend images to its immutable version.
Before mutating the host it checks x86_64/aarch64 support, distribution/dependency handling, Docker,
ports 80/9000/9001, 8 GiB of free disk, release availability, and existing state. Linux dependency
installation supports apt, dnf/yum, pacman and zypper families identified from `/etc/os-release`.

If `.spaceworks-version` already exists, pasting the command again offers update, module changes, both,
or cancel; it never reruns first-instance setup. A non-empty install root without the marker is refused.

## Production Compose

Use the production Compose file when deploying published images:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill the required values, then provision the root-owned pointer/key/config state once.
bash scripts/init-host-orchestration.sh
scripts/spaceworks-compose.sh bundled up -d
```

Set these values before first boot:

```env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-strong-password
POSTGRES_APP_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-different-strong-password
SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
ALLOWED_HOSTS=inventory.example.org
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://inventory.example.org
PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL=http://inventory.example.org
MINIO_ROOT_USER=replace-with-a-random-access-key
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
AWS_S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL=http://inventory.example.org:9000
PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL=http://inventory.example.org:9000/public-images
MINIO_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://inventory.example.org
ENABLE_HTTPS=false
AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE=Lax
AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=False
MAKERSPACE_IMAGE_TAG=latest
```

Optional image overrides:

```env
MAKERSPACE_BACKEND_IMAGE=ghcr.io/spaceworks-hq/spaceworks-backend
MAKERSPACE_FRONTEND_IMAGE=ghcr.io/spaceworks-hq/spaceworks-frontend
```

### Build from source (explicit opt-in)

Release images are published to GHCR and `setup.sh` pulls them by default. A developer with a full
source tree can explicitly build locally:

```bash
bash setup.sh --build
```

For a guided first run that generates secrets, the atomic pointer and `.env`, use the curl installer or
`setup.sh` at the repo root (see [setup-for-makerspaces.md](setup-for-makerspaces.md)).

Windows has two explicit support tiers. Install, normal Compose operation, upgrades and module changes
work natively with Docker Desktop plus Git Bash. In-place restore, backup import and compound recovery
must run under WSL2: their security boundary depends on Linux AF_UNIX sockets and root-owned-file trust
semantics and is deliberately not emulated on Windows.

> The frontend container's nginx proxies `/api/`, `/static/`, and the docs routes to the backend.
> The **single published port (80)** serves the public app, the React staff console at `/admin`,
> and Swagger. The Django control plane is mounted at `/control/` on the backend and is
> intentionally **not exposed** on the public frontend port; access it only through direct backend
> access.

## First Run

Create the first superadmin and makerspace:

```bash
scripts/spaceworks-compose.sh bundled run --rm --no-deps backend --role management python manage.py setup_instance \
  --username admin \
  --email admin@example.org \
  --password "replace-with-a-strong-password" \
  --makerspace-name "My Makerspace"
```

The command is idempotent. It creates missing records and upgrades the named user to a superadmin if needed.

## Health Checks

Backend:

```text
GET /api/v1/health/
GET /api/v1/health/readiness/
```

The Compose files include health checks for Postgres, backend readiness, and frontend HTTP serving.

## Scheduled Jobs

Return reminder emails are sent by a management command. The bundled Compose profiles run it through the
role-aware image entrypoint. An external cron, systemd timer, Windows Task Scheduler, or provider scheduler
must additionally be disabled by its control plane unless the host restore marker is `normal` or
`acknowledged-normal` (or it must call the same host gate); otherwise that topology is refused because it
can retain credentials and bypass the
container marker. Once that fence is configured, schedule it every 15-60 minutes:

```bash
scripts/spaceworks-compose.sh bundled run --rm --no-deps backend --role management python manage.py send_return_reminders
```

The command is idempotent. It only sends reminders for issued or partially returned requests whose `return_due_at` is in the past and whose reminder has not already been sent. Requests returned before the due time are skipped.

## Automatic and manual upgrades

Every successful push to `main` publishes matching backend/frontend images and a GitHub Release. The
release is marked latest only after both images are available. The self-host updater uses that release
as its gate, creates a PostgreSQL backup, deploys the exact immutable tag, runs migrations through the
Compose migration service, and records the version only after the readiness check passes.

Guided setup offers automatic checks every seven days by default. A Super Admin can then open
**Staff console -> Platform settings -> Software updates** to turn automatic installation on or off,
see the installed/latest versions, or queue **Update now**. The web application never receives Docker
socket access: it records the request in PostgreSQL and the host scheduler performs the privileged work.
Turning automatic installation off leaves the seven-day host check active, so release information and
manual requests still work without installing anything automatically.
Install or repair the schedule manually with:

```bash
bash scripts/install-auto-update.sh  # Linux, or WSL2 on Windows
```

Run an immediate checked update with:

```bash
bash scripts/update.sh --force
```

When run in a terminal, the updater opens the same live-registry module tick list after the release is
healthy. It is seeded from each makerspace's current `enabled_modules`, not an install profile. Cron has
no terminal and therefore performs only the release update. Useful explicit forms are:

```bash
# Explicitly open the live module tick list after a checked update.
bash scripts/update.sh --force --modules

# Update the release without reviewing or changing modules.
bash scripts/update.sh --force --no-module-changes

# Change modules without checking for a release.
bash scripts/update.sh --modules-only --makerspace my-space

# Non-interactively enable all optional modules except two for one makerspace.
bash scripts/update.sh --all-modules --without=printing,payments \
  --makerspace my-space --confirm-removals

# A cross-tenant change is never implicit.
bash scripts/update.sh --all-modules --all-makerspaces
```

With multiple makerspaces, interactive use asks for a slug; non-interactive use refuses unless given
`--makerspace` or the explicit `--all-makerspaces` opt-in. Unticking/disabling a module requires
confirmation and runs the two-pass dependency-safe uninstall loop. It only invokes `uninstall_module`:
retained rows are never purged by setup or update. `--modules` forces the interactive review;
`--modules-only`, `--all-modules`, `--without=a,b`, `--makerspace <slug>`, `--all-makerspaces`,
`--confirm-removals` and `--no-module-changes` provide explicit non-default behavior for operators and
automation.

Pre-update database dumps are written to `backups/` and retained for 14 days. Each compressed dump
contains PostgreSQL data: users, settings, inventory, requests, loan history, and audit metadata. It does
**not** contain MinIO objects such as evidence photos, machine images, documents, or print files; back up
the `minio_data` volume separately. The database snapshot is a recovery point and is never restored
automatically.

The scripts use `.spaceworks-update.lock` to prevent overlapping runs and `.spaceworks-version` to avoid
redeploying the same release. If migration, deployment, or readiness fails after replacement starts, the
updater automatically pulls and starts the previous retained application release, then verifies its
health. The version marker is not advanced, the UI records whether rollback succeeded, and the database
backup remains available. Database migrations are not reversed automatically; keep migrations backward
compatible with the immediately previous application release. If application rollback also fails, review
`backups/auto-update.log` before restoring the database snapshot and previous image tag manually.

On hosts with `flock`, the updater also holds the shared host operation-lock inode. Native Windows Git
Bash normally lacks `flock`, so update falls back to the existing directory lock, recording its owner PID
and start timestamp. A dead owner is detected and cleared on the next run. A live or unreadable owner is
never silently discarded: after verifying no update is active, pass `--override-lock`. This fallback is
for install/run/update only; run `scripts/restore.sh` and other compound recovery supervisors under WSL2.

For a manual deployment, set `MAKERSPACE_IMAGE_TAG` to a release such as
`0.5.1-main.42.a1b2c3d4e5f6`, then run:

```bash
scripts/spaceworks-compose.sh bundled pull
scripts/spaceworks-compose.sh bundled up -d
```

Do not schedule a blind container watcher: application images must not restart without the migration
service and readiness gate. Manual dependency audit: `pip install pip-audit && pip-audit -r backend/requirements.txt`.

### Host configuration changes

Any edit to `.env` or a Compose file requires rerunning `bash scripts/init-host-orchestration.sh` before
using the Compose wrapper again. `backend/apps/backup/host_topology_record.py` hashes the static environment
and every Compose file into a root-owned topology record; if either changes,
`validate_compose_wrapper` raises `Compose configuration digest drifted`. This check fails closed, so the
next Compose command refuses to run until the trusted record is rebuilt.

`scripts/update.sh` deploys new images only. It does not fetch newer Compose files, Caddyfiles, or host
scripts, so automatic updates leave an existing deployment's host files unchanged; changes to those files
must be installed manually. The curl installer is not a repair or reinstall path either: when `install.sh`
finds the `.spaceworks-version` marker, it defers to the already-installed `scripts/update.sh` instead of
replacing host files, so rerunning the installer cannot correct a stale file.

The TLS overlay pins Caddy to an explicit patch release. `scripts/update.sh` pulls only the SpaceWorks
backend and frontend images, not Caddy, so installing a Caddy security update requires changing that pin in
`docker/compose.tls.yml`, rerunning `bash scripts/init-host-orchestration.sh`, and bringing the Compose layer
up again.

After switching an existing deployment from plain HTTP to the TLS layer, rerun the installer
with the layer prefix, `SPACEWORKS_COMPOSE_LAYER=tls bash scripts/install-auto-update.sh`. The installed cron command records the Compose layer that was active
when the schedule was installed; without reinstalling it, an unattended update continues using the old
plain-HTTP layer.

## Publishing new images (maintainers)

Every push to `main` runs `release.yml`, publishes matching backend and frontend images, and creates a
GitHub Release titled with the version from `VERSION` (for example, `v0.5.1`). Its internal tag still
identifies the exact build used by the updater. When both images succeed for the current branch head, the workflow promotes
them to the rolling `:X.Y`, `:main`, and `:latest` tags, then removes older Releases and GHCR versions.
The current and immediately previous builds remain available so a failed deployment can roll its
application containers back automatically.

The root **`VERSION`** file selects the semantic release series. Edit it (for example, to `1.0.0`) only
when starting a new series; the workflow adds the run number and commit SHA to every release automatically.

The `spaceworks-backend` / `spaceworks-frontend` GHCR packages must be set to **Public** (org → Packages)
so operators can `docker compose pull` without authenticating.

## HTTPS & security hardening

TLS-dependent settings are **env-gated, not `DEBUG`-gated**, so the default HTTP stack works out of
the box. The default frontend nginx does **not** trust inbound `X-Forwarded-Proto`; it forwards only
its own scheme to Django.

For a real domain with automatic TLS, use the Caddy overlay:

```env
PUBLIC_DOMAIN=inventory.example.org
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://inventory.example.org
PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL=https://inventory.example.org
STORAGE_DOMAIN=files.inventory.example.org
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://inventory.example.org
AWS_S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL=https://files.inventory.example.org
PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://files.inventory.example.org/public-images
MINIO_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://inventory.example.org
ENABLE_HTTPS=true
AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE=Lax
```

```bash
SPACEWORKS_COMPOSE_LAYER=tls scripts/spaceworks-compose.sh bundled up -d
# Reinstall the updater WITH the same prefix, or it records a plain-HTTP cron job.
SPACEWORKS_COMPOSE_LAYER=tls bash scripts/install-auto-update.sh
```

The variable is a one-command assignment and does not persist, so it has to be repeated on
the `install-auto-update.sh` line too. Without it the installer resolves the layer to `none`
and writes a base-topology cron job: the next unattended update then tries to publish the
frontend on port 80 while Caddy already holds 80/443, and the rollback repeats it.

This overlay forces `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=True`, because a refresh cookie without `Secure` is
never correct on an HTTPS deployment and `setup.sh` writes `False` for the plain-HTTP origin
it configures. `AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE` stays yours to set: the bundled frontend is same-origin,
so `Lax` is right, while a frontend on a separate origin needs `None`.

The Compose layer now both selects and activates the TLS overlay. The Caddy service no longer has a
redundant `profiles: ["tls"]` activation gate: `scripts/update.sh` runs `up -d` without `--profile`, so
keeping that second gate made every unattended update bring the stack back without its TLS terminator and
roll the deployment back into the same plain-HTTP topology.

`STORAGE_DOMAIN` creates the `files.` hostname as a Caddy site in `deploy/Caddyfile`, where it proxies
`minio:9000`; its host must match the host in `AWS_S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL`. Create DNS records for both the
application hostname and the storage hostname before starting the overlay, or ACME certificate issuance
cannot succeed. `PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL` must also be set explicitly because `setup.sh` initializes it to
`http://<host>:9000/public-images`. Leaving that plaintext value in place makes every public item photo and
makerspace logo a mixed-content failure in an HTTPS browser, even after presigned uploads work.

The TLS overlay removes MinIO's inherited host port publications, including plaintext `0.0.0.0:9000`.
Only Caddy's HTTPS `STORAGE_DOMAIN` site is reachable from outside the Compose network; the backend and
Caddy continue to reach MinIO internally at `minio:9000`.

The overlay enables `ENABLE_HTTPS=true` and `TRUST_X_FORWARDED_PROTO=true` for the backend. Caddy is then
the trusted TLS boundary: `/api`, `/static`, and docs paths go directly to Django with
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`, while the React app goes to the frontend container. Keep any direct
backend/frontend HTTP ports private when the TLS overlay is active.



Always-on protections (any transport): `django-axes` locks out brute-force admin logins
(`AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT`, keyed by ip+username), a scoped throttle limits the JWT login endpoint, the
public submit endpoint has its own anti-spam throttle + a honeypot, and a Content-Security-Policy is
sent on every response. The Django control plane at `/control/` is restricted to active
superusers only and must be reached through direct backend access, never through the public
frontend port.

Secrets (`SECRET_KEY`, `API_CLIENT_ENC_KEY`, makerspace Telegram bot tokens, makerspace SMTP
passwords) live only in the backend. `API_CLIENT_ENC_KEY` is the Fernet key that encrypts the
per-makerspace integration secrets at rest — **back it up and do not rotate it casually**, or
previously stored tokens/passwords can no longer be decrypted.

## Custom domain (self-host)

On a self-hosted instance (the default — `PLATFORM_DOMAIN_SUFFIX` is **blank**) you own both DNS and
the server, so a makerspace's custom domain is **trusted the moment a superadmin sets it** — there is
no DNS TXT challenge. (The TXT-verification flow only exists to defend the shared managed `space-works.tech`
box; it stays dormant here.) End-to-end:

1. **Point DNS at the server.** Create an `A`/`AAAA` record for the hostname (for example
   `tools.example.org`) pointing at this deployment's public IP.
2. **Enable automatic HTTPS.** Staff login on a custom domain requires HTTPS — the staff-auth
   allowlist only trusts the `https://` origin (localhost dev is the sole `http` exception). Set the
   TLS env and bring up the Caddy overlay:

   ```env
   PUBLIC_DOMAIN=tools.example.org
   CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://tools.example.org
   # Django's own host check (CommonMiddleware) is separate from the tenant host
   # middleware — add every custom hostname here or requests 400 with DisallowedHost.
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,tools.example.org
   ```

   ```bash
   SPACEWORKS_COMPOSE_LAYER=tls scripts/spaceworks-compose.sh bundled up -d
   ```

   Caddy (`deploy/Caddyfile`) terminates HTTPS and forwards both the public site and the `/admin`
   staff console to this deployment.
3. **Set the domain in Settings.** As a **superadmin**, open the makerspace's Settings → **Custom
   domain**, enter the hostname, and Save. It shows **Active** immediately (no TXT record, no Verify
   step). Only a superadmin may set it — the staff-auth/CORS allowlist is process-global (not
   tenant-scoped), so on a multi-makerspace box an untrusted Space Manager must never be able to inject
   a globally-trusted origin. This holds even for a makerspace hidden from the superadmin
   (`superadmin_access_enabled=False`): to set its domain, have its Space Manager re-enable superadmin
   access, set the domain as the superadmin, then re-hide it.
4. **Point the branded frontend at this backend.** Set the frontend container's
   `TENANT_ORIGIN_BOOTSTRAP=true` (resolve the makerspace by request origin) **or**
   `TENANT_TOKEN=<public_code>`, plus `TENANT_API_URL=/api`. See
   [single-tenant-frontend.md](single-tenant-frontend.md).

If an instance flips from managed → self-host after deploy, run
`python manage.py reconcile_selfhost_domains` once to promote any existing custom domains to trusted
(the migration does this automatically on a fresh self-host deploy).

## Object Storage

Production Compose includes MinIO because the backend stores evidence photos and 3D-print files in
S3-compatible object storage by default. The backend talks to MinIO at `http://minio:9000`; browsers
use `AWS_S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL` in presigned upload/download URLs, so that value must be reachable
from staff/requester browsers.

Public catalog images use a separate `PUBLIC_IMAGE_BUCKET` that is anonymous-readable by design.
The bundled Compose bootstrap creates it, sets `download` policy, and applies the same upload CORS
policy. Keep evidence and print files in the private `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`; only item photos and
makerspace logo/cover images belong in the public bucket.

For HTTPS deployments, put MinIO behind the same TLS proxy as the frontend, for example:

```env
AWS_S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL=https://files.inventory.example.org
MINIO_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://inventory.example.org
```

If you expose MinIO directly on a LAN during a local pilot, set `AWS_S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL` to the
server address and port that browsers can reach, for example `http://192.168.1.20:9000`. The MinIO
console binds to `127.0.0.1:9001` by default; keep it private or put it behind authenticated VPN/admin
access.

## Backups

Operational data lives in Postgres and object files live in the `minio_data` Docker volume. Back up
both before upgrades:

```bash
scripts/spaceworks-compose.sh bundled exec -T db \
  pg_dump -U makerspace makerspace_manager > backup-$(date +%F).sql

mkdir -p backups
scripts/spaceworks-compose.sh bundled run --rm --entrypoint sh \
  -v "$PWD/backups:/backup" \
  minio \
  -c 'tar -czf /backup/minio-$(date +%F).tgz -C /data .'
```

Also keep a copy of your `.env` (it holds `API_CLIENT_ENC_KEY`, without which encrypted integration
secrets are unrecoverable, and the MinIO credentials needed to read object backups).

Restore order is database first, then object files. Stop the stack, restore the Postgres dump into the
`db` service, unpack the MinIO archive into the `minio_data` volume, then start the stack and check
`/api/v1/health/readiness/`.

## Tenant Frontends

One backend can serve **many makerspaces**. A makerspace without its own server can be hosted as an
additional tenant on another makerspace's instance — each tenant gets its own makerspace record,
public URL/slug, branding, and (optionally) its own branded domain, all isolated by makerspace
scoping. To give a tenant its own branded site, set its **Custom domain**
(`Makerspace.frontend_domain`) in the staff console Settings tab; that single field drives CORS,
bootstrap resolution, and the staff-auth allowlist. See `docs/single-tenant-frontend.md`.

Browser frontends must use publishable configuration only. Do not place HMAC secrets in JavaScript bundles.

Use `GET /api/v1/bootstrap?tenant=<public-code>` or `GET /api/v1/bootstrap?slug=<makerspace-slug>`
(or simply serve the branded site from its `frontend_domain`, which bootstrap resolves by origin) to load:

- makerspace identity
- enabled modules and workflows
- theme and branding
- publishable public API hints

The React public and staff frontends use `enabled_modules` as live navigation gates. If a tenant does
not see a workflow, check the makerspace module flags first: `self_checkout` gates public
self-checkout and staff direct handout, `printing` gates 3D-printing workflows, `stocktake` gates
stocktake, `containers` gates container tools, `qr_management` gates QR tools/scanner, and reports
appear for `reports` or printing-related workflows.

A makerspace's `frontend_domain` and its `cors_allowed_origins` (API-client origins) are used for
per-tenant browser access; only the `frontend_domain` origin may hold a staff session.
